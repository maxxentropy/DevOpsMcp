# Phase 1 Progress Update

## Completed Today

### 1. âœ… Test eagle_history tool
- Successfully tested the eagle_history tool
- Verified it can query execution history by session ID
- Tool is fully functional and working as expected

### 2. âœ… Implement automatic structured output detection
- Added `TryConvertToStructuredOutput` method to EagleScriptExecutor
- Detects if Eagle script returns valid JSON
- Detects if result is a Tcl list (logs but doesn't convert in Phase 1)
- For Phase 1, simplified implementation relies on explicit mcp::output command
- Full JSON conversion can be enhanced in future phases

### 3. âœ… Add deep context path access support
- Updated ContextCommand to support deep paths like "project.lastBuild.status"
- Added support for:
  - project.lastBuild.status
  - project.lastBuild.id
  - project.lastBuild.date
  - project.repository.url
  - project.repository.branch
- Paths use simulated data for now (can be connected to real Azure DevOps APIs later)
- Created test script: DeepContextPaths.test.tcl

### 4. ðŸ”„ Test security policy enforcement (Ready for Testing)
- Created comprehensive security test script: SecurityPolicy.test.tcl
- Tests file operations, command execution, sockets, environment access, and interpreter creation
- Created test runners for all four security levels:
  - test-security-minimal.py (Most restrictive)
  - test-security-standard.py (Balanced)
  - test-security-elevated.py (Less restrictive)
  - test-security-maximum.py (Least restrictive)
- Created run-security-tests.sh to execute all tests

## Still Pending

### 1. Test session persistence across restarts
- Need to set a session value, restart container, and verify it persists
- SQLite implementation exists but needs verification

### 2. Test interpreter pool management
- Need to run concurrent scripts and verify pool behavior
- Test pool exhaustion and cleanup

### 3. Test package import functionality
- ImportPackagesAsync exists but needs actual Eagle packages to test
- Currently marked as "will be tested when packages available"

### 4. Review and fix any other Tcl-specific commands to use Eagle primitives
- Already fixed dict command to use Eagle list parsing
- Need to scan for other Tcl-specific usage

### 5. Create unit tests for core components
- ExecutionHistoryStore
- EagleSessionStore  
- EagleScriptExecutor

## Summary
Phase 1 implementation is nearly complete! The core functionality is working:
- âœ… All three official test scripts pass
- âœ… MCP commands (context, session, call_tool, output) working
- âœ… Eagle interpreter integration successful
- âœ… Session management implemented
- âœ… Execution history tracking
- âœ… Deep context paths
- âœ… Basic structured output detection
- ðŸ”„ Security policies ready for testing

The remaining items are mostly testing and verification of already-implemented features.
