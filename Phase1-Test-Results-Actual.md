# Phase 1 Actual Test Results

## Test Run Date: 2025-08-03

## Summary
- **Total Tests**: 11
- **Passed**: 8
- **Failed**: 3
- **Success Rate**: 72.7%

## Detailed Results

### ✅ Passed Tests

1. **Phase1Complete.test.tcl** - PASSED (with issues)
   - ✅ Working directory check (but shows `/app` not `/tmp`)
   - ❌ Environment variable TEST_VAR not injected
   - ✅ Package import ready
   - ✅ MCP tool calling works (11 projects found)
   - ✅ Context access works
   - ✅ Output formatting works

2. **RichContext.test.tcl** - PASSED (16/18 subtests)
   - ✅ mcp::context command exists
   - ✅ Context data retrieval works
   - ❌ Boolean context values not returning boolean strings
   - ✅ Session management works
   - ✅ Tool calling works
   - ✅ Error handling works
   - ❌ Production check failed

3. **StructuredOutput.test.tcl** - PASSED (27/27 subtests)
   - ✅ All output formats working correctly
   - ✅ JSON, XML, YAML, Table, CSV all functional

4. **Security Tests** - PASSED (but CRITICAL ISSUE)
   - ⚠️ **ALL security levels allow ALL operations!**
   - ⚠️ File access, exec, sockets all allowed at "Minimal" level
   - ⚠️ Security policies are NOT being enforced

5. **Concurrent Pool Test** - PASSED
   - ✅ Successfully handled 30 concurrent requests
   - ✅ All requests completed successfully
   - ✅ Average response time ~2 seconds

6. **Eagle History Test** - PASSED
   - ✅ History retrieval works correctly

### ❌ Failed Tests

1. **DeepContextPaths.test.tcl** - FAILED
   - Error: `wrong # args: should be "mcp::context get key.path"`
   - Fix: Added missing "get" argument to all mcp::context calls

2. **InterpreterPool.test.tcl** - FAILED
   - Error: Eagle doesn't support ternary operator `? :`
   - Fix: Replaced with lreverse for simple shuffle

3. **Session Persistence Setup** - FAILED
   - Failed to extract session ID from output
   - The session ID is not being returned in the execution result

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Security Policies Not Enforced
All security levels (Minimal, Standard, Elevated, Maximum) are allowing:
- File read/write operations
- Command execution
- Socket creation
- Environment access

This is a CRITICAL security vulnerability!

### 2. Environment Variables Not Injected
The TEST_VAR environment variable specified in the test is not being injected into the Eagle interpreter.

### 3. Working Directory Mismatch
Tests expect `/tmp` but getting `/app`

### 4. Session ID Not in Output
The execute_eagle_script tool is not returning the session ID in its response, making session persistence testing difficult.

## Recommendations

1. **URGENT**: Fix security policy enforcement
2. Fix environment variable injection
3. Fix working directory setting
4. Include session ID in tool response
5. Update DeepContextPaths.test.tcl and InterpreterPool.test.tcl with fixes

## Next Steps
1. Apply the test fixes and rebuild
2. Investigate why security policies aren't being enforced
3. Fix environment variable and working directory issues
4. Update tool response to include session ID
