# DevOps MCP Server - Development Status

## Project Overview
This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Azure DevOps integration with an advanced AI persona system.

## Current Status (as of 2025-08-01)

### ‚úÖ Completed Work
1. Base DevOps MCP Server with Clean Architecture
2. Full Azure DevOps API integration (work items, builds, repos, etc.)
3. Docker containerization with successful builds
4. Advanced Persona System implementation:
   - Core interfaces and base classes
   - 4 specialized personas (DevOps Engineer, SRE, Security Engineer, Engineering Manager)
   - Behavior adaptation framework
   - Memory management system
   - Orchestration engine
   - MCP tools for persona interaction
5. Fixed all build errors in main code (0 errors, warnings only)
6. Added persona service registration to Program.cs
7. Configured infrastructure services for persona memory store

### üî¥ Critical Issues
1. **Test Compilation**: 89 errors in test projects preventing tests from running
2. **Environment Variables**: Need to handle Azure DevOps credentials securely
3. **Persona Integration**: Persona system exists but not integrated with main workflow

### üü° Outstanding Persona Features
1. **Learning Engine**: Stubbed but not implemented
2. **Context Extraction**: No real Azure DevOps context integration
3. **Memory Persistence**: File store exists but untested
4. **Orchestration Logic**: Minimal coordination between personas
5. **Security Controls**: No RBAC or audit trails
6. **Monitoring**: No metrics or health checks for personas

### üìÅ Key Files Modified
- `/src/DevOpsMcp.Server/Program.cs` - Added persona service registration
- `/src/DevOpsMcp.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs` - Added persona infrastructure
- `/src/DevOpsMcp.Server/appsettings.json` - Removed exposed PAT
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed to exclude test projects
- Various files - Added missing using directives

### üöÄ Next Steps
1. Fix test compilation errors
2. Implement persona learning engine
3. Add Azure DevOps context extraction
4. Create persona selection API
5. Test memory persistence
6. Add monitoring/metrics

### üíæ Git Status
- Repository: git@github.com:maxxentropy/DevOpsMcp.git
- Latest commit: "Fix Docker build errors and missing using directives"
- All changes pushed to master branch

### üê≥ Docker Status
- Image builds successfully as `devops-mcp:latest`
- Monitoring stack configured (Prometheus, Grafana, Redis)
- Simple compose file available: `docker-compose.simple.yml`

### üîß Configuration Notes
- Requires Azure DevOps PAT and Organization URL
- Supports stdio, SSE, and HTTP protocols
- Persona memory stored in LocalApplicationData/DevOpsMcp/PersonaMemory

### üìä Implementation Progress
- Core MCP Server: 100%
- Azure DevOps Integration: 100%
- Persona Framework: 40%
- Testing: 0% (blocked by compilation errors)
- Documentation: 70%

## Important Commands
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t devops-mcp .

# Run with Docker Compose (simple version)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up

# Run with full monitoring stack
docker-compose up

# Set environment variables before running
export AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL="https://dev.azure.com/your-org"
export AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT="your-pat-token"
```

## Known Issues
- CS8632 warnings about nullable reference types throughout
- Test projects have compilation errors
- Persona services need comprehensive testing
- No UI for persona management

This file serves as a checkpoint for continuing development of the DevOps MCP Server with the persona system.
