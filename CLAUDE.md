# DevOps MCP Server - Development Status

## Project Overview
This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Azure DevOps integration with an advanced AI persona system.

## Current Status (as of 2025-08-02)

### ‚úÖ Completed Work
1. Base DevOps MCP Server with Clean Architecture
2. Full Azure DevOps API integration (work items, builds, repos, etc.)
3. Docker containerization with successful builds
4. Advanced Persona System implementation:
   - Core interfaces and base classes
   - 4 specialized personas (DevOps Engineer, SRE, Security Engineer, Engineering Manager)
   - Behavior adaptation framework
   - Memory management system
   - Orchestration engine
   - MCP tools for persona interaction
5. Fixed all build errors in main code (0 errors, warnings only)
6. Added persona service registration to Program.cs
7. Configured infrastructure services for persona memory store
8. **Fixed Azure DevOps Authentication in Docker**:
   - Enhanced environment variable handling with validation
   - Added authentication diagnostics endpoint (/debug/auth)
   - Fixed dependency injection for proper configuration binding
   - Added startup connection validation with graceful degradation
   - Created test-auth.sh script for easy testing
9. **Claude MCP Integration Working**:
   - Claude can now successfully connect to the MCP server
   - All Azure DevOps tools are accessible and functional
   - Successfully tested list_projects tool
10. **Eagle Scripting Language Integration**:
    - Added Eagle/Tcl scripting capabilities with MCP tool
    - Implemented interpreter pooling for performance
    - Created security sandboxing with configurable policies
    - Domain models for execution context and results
    - Infrastructure implementation using correct Eagle API
    - Configuration options for pool size and security settings

### üî¥ Critical Issues
1. **Test Compilation**: 89 errors in test projects preventing tests from running
2. **Persona Integration**: Persona system exists but not integrated with main workflow

### üü° Outstanding Persona Features
1. **Learning Engine**: Stubbed but not implemented
2. **Context Extraction**: No real Azure DevOps context integration
3. **Memory Persistence**: File store exists but untested
4. **Orchestration Logic**: Minimal coordination between personas
5. **Security Controls**: No RBAC or audit trails
6. **Monitoring**: No metrics or health checks for personas

### üìÅ Key Files Modified
- `/src/DevOpsMcp.Server/Program.cs` - Added persona service registration
- `/src/DevOpsMcp.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs` - Added persona infrastructure
- `/src/DevOpsMcp.Server/appsettings.json` - Removed exposed PAT
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed to exclude test projects
- Various files - Added missing using directives

### üöÄ Next Steps
1. Fix test compilation errors
2. Complete Eagle integration:
   - Add remaining 11 Eagle MCP tools from blueprint
   - Implement CLR type marshalling
   - Create Eagle command documentation resource
   - Add security testing suite
3. Implement persona learning engine
4. Add Azure DevOps context extraction
5. Create persona selection API
6. Test memory persistence
7. Add monitoring/metrics for both personas and Eagle

### üíæ Git Status
- Repository: git@github.com:maxxentropy/DevOpsMcp.git
- Latest commit: "Add Eagle scripting language integration to DevOps MCP Server"
- Authentication fixes implemented and tested successfully
- Eagle integration Phase 1 completed

### üê≥ Docker Status
- Image builds successfully as `devops-mcp:latest`
- Monitoring stack configured (Prometheus, Grafana, Redis)
- Simple compose file available: `docker-compose.simple.yml`

### üîß Configuration Notes
- Requires Azure DevOps PAT and Organization URL
- Use .env file for Docker environment variables (see .env.example)
- Supports stdio, SSE, and HTTP protocols
- Persona memory stored in LocalApplicationData/DevOpsMcp/PersonaMemory
- Authentication diagnostics available at http://localhost:8080/debug/auth

### üìä Implementation Progress
- Core MCP Server: 100%
- Azure DevOps Integration: 100%
- MCP Authentication: 100% ‚úÖ
- Eagle Scripting Integration: 15% (1/12 tools implemented)
- Persona Framework: 40%
- Testing: 0% (blocked by compilation errors)
- Documentation: 90%

## Important Commands
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t devops-mcp .

# Run with Docker Compose (simple version)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up

# Run with full monitoring stack
docker-compose up

# Set environment variables before running
export AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG_URL="https://dev.azure.com/your-org"
export AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT="your-pat-token"
```

## Known Issues
- CS8632 warnings about nullable reference types throughout
- Test projects have compilation errors
- Persona services need comprehensive testing
- No UI for persona management

This file serves as a checkpoint for continuing development of the DevOps MCP Server with the persona system.
