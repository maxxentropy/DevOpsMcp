# Phase 1 Test Fixes Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Security Policy Enforcement (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: All security levels were allowing all operations (file access, exec, sockets)
**Fix**: Updated `InterpreterPool.CreateSafeInterpreter()` to:
- Set `InterpreterFlags.Safe` for Minimal and Standard security levels
- Call `interpreter.HideUnsafeCommands()` for Minimal security
- Remove specific commands based on security policy:
  - File system commands (file, glob, cd, pwd) when `AllowFileSystemAccess = false`
  - Network commands (socket, uri) when `AllowNetworkAccess = false`
  - Process commands (exec, pid) for Minimal security

### 2. Environment Variable Injection
**Problem**: TEST_VAR was not being injected into the Eagle interpreter
**Fix**: Updated `run_eagle_test.py` to:
- Accept environment variables as a parameter
- Default to including `TEST_VAR: "test_value_123"`
- Pass environment variables as JSON to the execute_eagle_script tool

### 3. Working Directory Setting
**Problem**: Tests expected `/tmp` but were getting `/app`
**Fix**: Updated `run_eagle_test.py` to:
- Accept working directory as a parameter
- Default to `/tmp` for tests
- Pass working directory to the execute_eagle_script tool

### 4. Session ID in Tool Response
**Problem**: Session ID was not included in the execution result
**Fix**: Updated `EagleExecutionTool.cs` to include `sessionId` in the response

### 5. Test Script Syntax Errors
**Problem**: Eagle doesn't support Tcl ternary operator and requires "get" argument for mcp::context
**Fixes**:
- `DeepContextPaths.test.tcl`: Added "get" argument to all mcp::context calls
- `InterpreterPool.test.tcl`: Replaced ternary operator with lreverse for simple shuffle

## Files Modified

  - Updated `CreateSafeInterpreter()` method

### Environment Variables & Working Directory
- `/tests/Eagle/TestRunners/run_eagle_test.py`
  - Added env_vars and working_dir parameters
  - Set defaults for TEST_VAR and /tmp

### Session ID Response
- `/src/DevOpsMcp.Server/Tools/Eagle/EagleExecutionTool.cs`
  - Added sessionId to response object

### Test Scripts
- `/tests/Eagle/TestScripts/DeepContextPaths.test.tcl`
- `/tests/Eagle/TestScripts/InterpreterPool.test.tcl`

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild the Docker container with these fixes
2. Re-run all tests to verify the fixes work
3. Update test documentation with the results
